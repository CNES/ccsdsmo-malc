<!-- 
    The project.xml generates build environments for:

        * android
        * autotool
        * cmake
        * mingw32
        * cygwin
        * vs2008
        * vs2010
        * vs2012
        * vs2013

    Classes are automatically added to all build environments. Further as you
    add new classes to your project you can generate skeleton header and source 
    files according to http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:21.

    description := A short description for your project

        Actors, are build using the simple actor framework from czmq. If the 
        actors class header or source file doesn't exist this will generate a
        skeleton for them. The generated test method of the actor will teach
        you how to use them. Also have a look at the czmq docs to learn more
        about actors.
